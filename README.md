# TFBS-PSSV
Position-specific scoring vectors for transcription factor binding sites. This repository contains jupyter notebooks (tested on julia 1.9.1) for reproducing the PSSV and conditional PSSV logos from the paper, Pavitra Selvakumar and Rahul Siddharthan, “Position-specific evolution in transcription factor binding sites, and a fast likelihood calculation for the F81 model” (link to appear shortly).

To view the notebooks, just click on them. The files in the `primates` and `mammals` directory have been gzipped. Unzip them before running.
